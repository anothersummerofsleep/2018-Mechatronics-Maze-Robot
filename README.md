## 2018 UGS Mechatronics Grp8 Maze Robot

This repository documents the design and building of an autonomous robot. 
A printed circuit board of the H-Bridge will be designed and produced to allow our rover to achieve movement. 
A control algorithm that uses Fuzzy Logic to quantize input data from our ultrasound and infrared sensors will be devised to help our robot navigate a maze.
The robot was programmed to compete against other similar robots in the task of navigating a maze. Successful integration of electronics, control software and mechanical engineering was required to formulate the implemented solutions in the robot design.
