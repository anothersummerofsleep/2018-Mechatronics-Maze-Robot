Sensors (2017 REF)
Sensors plays an important part in navigating the robot. By reading and interpreting data, the information provided is translated to movement of the robot.
For this project we will be using the SRF05 Ultrasonic sensor and the Sharp GP2YOA41SKOF infrared sensor.
The infrared sensor will be mounted in the front of the car to detect the distance.
Two ultrasound sensors will be mounted on the sides to provide information when the vehicle is too close to the side of the wall. 

SRF05 Ultrasonic sensor
The ultrasonic sensor transmits a sonic burst off the walls of the maze, and measures the time taken to receive the echo pulse.
The time taken is used to calculate the distance of the wall. This sensor has a range of 1 to 400cm.
The sensor consist of 2 modes, mode 1 and mode 2. Mode 1 requires 4 pins to function. Mode 2 combines the echo and trigger pin.
This saves 1 pin. In this project we will be using mode 1 as we do not need to save pins.
The MCU possesses more than enough spare pins for the required configuration.

The infrared sensor produce an output voltage with respect to distance to the wall.  The distance and voltage are govern by equation 1:
Distance=11.89V/(3.02*Reading+0.0445V)-0.42     [Equation 1]
To derive this formula we look at the linearized graph provided from the data sheet in appendix [A-1].
Plotting a best fit line of the linearized graph will give a more accurate derivation of formula.
From the best fit line, we are able to get values of 2 points as shown in figure 2B.

From the linearized line, we are able to derive the equation of the line using y= mx+c
Gradient = m = Δy/Δx=(3-0.55)/(0.256-0.05)=11.89
y= 11.89x+c
Sub points x = 0.05, y = 0.55
0.55=12(0.05)+c
c=-0.0445
y= 11.89x-0.0445
Voltage=11.89(1/(Length+0.42))-0.0445
Length=11.89/(Voltage+0.0445)-0.42
The reading from the sensor is within range of 0 to 1. Therefore we have to multiply the reading by a constant in order to get the voltage. The constant is the maximum voltage reading from the distance vs voltage graph, which is 3.02.
Voltage=constant*Reading 
Voltage=3.02*Reading 

Hence, deriving equation [1]:
Distance=11.89V/(3.02*Reading+0.0445V)-0.42
